Readme - What this is about
================================

This is a simple app I'm creating for my demo lecture on AngularJS and Play framework.
Since I hate making things with no purpose at all, this is something that might have some limited use.

I'm first going to build it, and then ruin it by commenting out parts vital parts, so that I can
introduce them back in a clear and simple way to demonstrate different capabilities.

The purpose of this app is not to showcase every capability of the aforementioned frameworks,
as the demo is only 40 minutes long, or even serve as an example for future projects.
In places, I might prefer immediate simplicity over correct programming practices which result in greater simplicity in the long term.

About the project
-------------------------

The project, which I call Projects, is a simple app which will allow users to propose projects,
other users to vote on them, join them, or even adopt and lead them.
I'm sure this exists in some form, probably better,  but it is almost easier for me to make one the way I think it should
be done, rather than look for one I like. Plus, the main purpose is the demo lecture as mentioned above.
